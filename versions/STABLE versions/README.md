# muri_ai — STABLE Versions 🟢

This folder will contain all **STABLE releases** of the `muri_ai` library.

---

## What is a STABLE version?

A **STABLE version** is:
- fully tested
- considered safe for normal usage
- backward-compatible (as much as possible)
- documented and polished

Stable versions are released **only after** enough testing in BETA versions.

---

## Current Status

🚧 **No stable versions available yet**

The project is still in early development stages.  
The first versions are released as **BETA** in order to test ideas, logic, and structure.

---

## When will this folder be used?

This folder will start being populated when:
- the core API becomes consistent
- major bugs are fixed
- the library reaches a reliable baseline

Until then, all development happens in **BETA** and **EXPERIMENTAL** versions.

---

## Note

If you are looking for something usable right now, check:
- `BETA versions/`

Stable versions will come later. Slowly, but properly.
