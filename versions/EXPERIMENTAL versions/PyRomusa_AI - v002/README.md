# PyRomusa_AI — v002 🤖

- **Version type:** EXPERIMENTAL
- **Release date:** 2026-02-10

---

## Overview

This version/library focuses on creating a **very simple, beginner-friendly chatbot system**, built with custom logic instead of real machine learning models.

It exists to:
- help beginners understand how chatbot logic can work
- allow fast experimentation with simple AI-like behaviour
- avoid complex frameworks and heavy dependencies

What makes it different:
- no neural networks
- no hidden layers
- no external ML libraries
- fully custom, readable logic

> This version implements a basic chatbot that learns from full words and example-based responses.  
> No hidden layers or machine learning models are used in this implementation.

## The objective of this EXPERIMENTAL version

### `Memory upgrade`: **In this experiment, we can test chatbots that can remember the last conversation with the user**, so that the chatbot can generate a response based on the last conversation. Is this functionality good or does it still need to be adjusted?

---

### 1. _How to use this functionality?_

This functionality cannot be used just _'a `load_prepared_dataset()` and done'_, because the available prepared datasets do not have this functionality.

**But instead, you can create manual training examples yourself**, also adding this last conversation memory functionality.

Below, I've written all the functions and variables within them that are related to this new memory system:

``` python
from PyRomusa_AI import Chatbot

bot = Chatbot()


bot.trainer.add_data(
    if_last_input="",
    if_last_output=""
)

bot.reply_at(
    sensitivity=1,
    with_memory=True
)

```
|Variable|It can be found in|Required value type|Description|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:----|
|`if_last_input`|`bot.trainer.add_data()`|string|In this variable, the user's last prompt should be added, as a training example. A value is needed here because it influences the chatbot's response, depending on the last prompt written by the user. **This variable is useful if you want the chatbot to return a logical response related to the last input.**|
|`if_last_output`|`bot.trainer.add_data()`|string|In this variable, the chatbot's last response should be added, as a training example. A value is needed here because it influences the chatbot's response, depending on the last text generated by the chatbot. **This variable is useful if you want the chatbot to return a logical response related to the last output.**
|`sensitivity`|`bot.reply_at()`|integer|This variable **represents the minimum number of words that `if_last_input`/`if_last_output` should have in common with the user prompt/chatbot response** to actually influence the last conversation for the new conversation.|
|`with_memory`|`bot.reply_at()`|boolean|Did you know that this functionality with **the memory of the last conversation is optional**? Well, by setting a value between `True/False`, you will say whether you want the chatbot to take the last conversation into account or not, to influence the next message of your chatbot.|

### 1.2. Complete code example to use this functionality

``` python
from PyRomusa_AI import Chatbot

bot = Chatbot(chatbot_name="Memory Tester")

# 1. --- We add some minimal examples for training so that our chatbot is able to respond to messages ---
# 1.1. Just a classic example of training data, to start the chatbot vocabulary
bot.trainer.add_data(
    training_input_example="Hello chatbot!",
    training_output_example="Hello, what would you like me to help you with today?"
)

# 1.2. Expected part: training example where we say the user answers the chatbot's question 'Hello, what would you like me to help you with today?' from the previous conversation with 'No way, I didn't want to talk to you.'
bot.trainer.add_data(
    training_input_example="No way, I didn't want to talk to you.",
    training_output_example="Ah, okay, then another time you'll probably really need my help. Bye then!",

    if_last_output="Hello, what would you like me to help you with today?"
)

# 2. --- We start the chatbot training process ---
bot.trainer.start()


# 3. --- Generate chatbot responses ---
print("---\n")

print(f"{bot.chatbot_name}: {bot.reply_at(
    prompt = "Hello chatbot!",
    engine_name="stable",
    sensitivity=5,
    with_memory=True
)}")
print(f"{bot.chatbot_name}: {bot.reply_at(
    prompt = "No way, I didn't want to talk to you.",
    engine_name="stable",
    sensitivity=5,
    with_memory=True
)}")

print("\n---\n")

# Optional: How would your chatbot respond if it didn't remember the past conversation?

print(f"{bot.chatbot_name}: {bot.reply_at(
    prompt = "Hello chatbot!",
    engine_name="stable",
    sensitivity=5,
    with_memory=False # Make sure this variable is False.
)}")
print(f"{bot.chatbot_name}: {bot.reply_at(
    prompt = "No way, I didn't want to talk to you.",
    engine_name="stable",
    sensitivity=5,
    with_memory=False
)}")

```
NOTE: **The last conversation memory system, in this version, will only work if you select the reply engine called 'stable'.**

## 🔬 EXPERIMENTAL release notice:
- The API is experimental and under active development

- New features and ideas are being tested and may change

- Behaviour may be unstable or inconsistent across use cases

- Bugs, breaking changes, or incomplete functionality are expected

- Use this version mainly for testing, learning, and experimentation

## Quick Usage Examples

### 1. Creating your first functional chatbot ever
```python
from PyRomusa_AI import Chatbot

# Create a chatbot
bot = Chatbot(chatbot_name="RomusaBot")

# Add training data
bot.trainer.add_data("Hello!", "Hi there!")
bot.trainer.add_data("Bye!", "Goodbye!")

# Start training
bot.trainer.start()

# Get a response
print(bot.reply_at("Hello!"))
```
