# muri_ai — EXPERIMENTAL Versions 🧪

This folder contains **EXPERIMENTAL versions** of the `muri_ai` library.

---

## What does EXPERIMENTAL mean here?

In `muri_ai`, **EXPERIMENTAL versions are not dangerous or unusable**.

They are versions that:
- focus more on **testing new ideas** than on fixing every bug
- may contain unfinished or imperfect logic
- aim to be **functional at a basic level**
- keep syntax and usage **very similar to BETA and STABLE versions**

In practice, these versions are still **beginner-friendly**.

---

## How EXPERIMENTAL versions are used

EXPERIMENTAL versions are used to:
- try new training logic
- test alternative response systems
- experiment with internal structure
- explore ideas before stabilising them

Bug fixing is **not the main priority**, but basic functionality is always intended.

---

## Current Status

🚧 **No experimental versions available yet**

This folder will be populated when new ideas need to be tested before:
- moving into BETA
- or being discarded completely

---

## What to expect

In EXPERIMENTAL versions you can expect:
- similar syntax to BETA / STABLE
- familiar function usage
- possible logic inconsistencies
- fewer safeguards and validations

Despite this, the library should remain **usable for learning and testing**.

---

## Recommendation

- For structured learning → **BETA versions**
- For curiosity and early ideas → **EXPERIMENTAL versions**
- For long-term reliability → **STABLE versions (when available)**

---

## Note

If an experimental idea proves useful and stable enough,  
it may later appear in a **BETA** or **STABLE** release.
