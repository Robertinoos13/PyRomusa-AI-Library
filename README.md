Did you know that from `PyRomusa AI` you can load a ready-made training dataset to the model? Well, here's an example below:
``` python
from PyRomusa_AI import Chatbot

# 1. Create your chatbot
bot = Chatbot(chatbot_name="MyChatbot")

bot.prepared_datasets.romanian.load_prepared_dataset(dataset_name="low")

# 3. Start training
bot.trainer.start()

# 4. Enjoy to use the chatbot (Salut! = Hello!)
print(bot.reply_at(prompt="Salut!"))

```

_(Some values ​​in the `"Vocabulary"` and `"Number of examples"` columns may be approximate.)_

#### Explanation for Each Column

- _Dataset Name_ - **The dataset name will be written here so that each dataset is unique.**

- _Vocabulary_ - **This is where you will write the total number of different words in the dataset.** It is important for the chatbot to have a diverse vocabulary from different domains to talk about more things.

- _Number of examples_ - **This is where you will put the total number of input-output examples that the dataset has.** It is important to have a high number, because it is said that this way you have a better chance of answering more prompts correctly (theoretically speaking...).

- _Word to acces it_ - **Here we will put a recommended option to access the dataset in the `bot.prepared_datasets. ... ` function, putting it in `dataset_name` variable.** It is important to know how to access a specific dataset in your code.

- _Language_ - **This will be the language that most of the dataset examples are in**. It's important to understand what the chatbot is saying.

- _Naturalness_ - **This represents who the input/output examples  are made by and how.** Here only certain terms will be used, depending on each situation:

    - **No Effort** - The examples in the dataset are 100% AI-generated and not a single one is human-made.
    - **Critically Low** - The examples in the dataset are 99% generated with AI, but about 1% are human-made
    - **Very Low** - The examples in the dataset are 80% generated with AI, but about 20% are human-made
    - **Low** - The examples in the dataset are 60% generated with AI, but about 40% are human-made
    - **Balanced** - The examples in the dataset are 50% generated with AI, but about 50% are human-made
    - **High** - The examples in the dataset are 20% generated with AI, but about 80% are human-made
    - **Very High** - The examples in the dataset are 100% human-made, but probability some information in the examples in the dataset is not correct.
    - **Perfectly** - The examples in the dataset are 100% human-made, and also has verified information

        _(By the way: The datasets that are mostly human-made, the examples from them were added progressively, thus the chatbot "learns" from mistakes.)_
    
- _Focus on same questions_ - **Here you will find out how much focus was placed on the chatbot that has this dataset to recognize the same question, but written in a different form by the user.** It is important to know how much patience you need to have for the chatbot to understand what you are saying, so that it does not fallback or write something difficult to understand. Here you can find the following values:

    - **No Effort** - worst value
    - **Very Low**
    - **Low**
    - **Balanced**
    - **High**
    - **Very High** - best value

- _Planned to be updated_ - **This column will have only one of the 3 values: YES, NO or MAYBE.** This column shows whether the prepared dataset will be updated in the future. If YES, the dataset specifications vary depending on the version of `PyRomusa AI`.

- _Avaiable In_ - **Here you will find in which oldest version this dataset started appearing in.** It is important to know which version to look for in the `versions/` folder if you want to use a specific dataset.

## About **Reply Engines** 
**Did you know that you can change the logic in which the chatbot will generate a response?** Well, that's a new concept in the `STABLE 0.2.0` release!

**But why was this new concept added?** Well, it **was observed that with a changed logic for generating responses, the chatbot responds more chaotically, more stably, or more precisely to a certain length of the prompt**, so that's how the concept of engines was born: _to optimize the goal of your chatbot._

### Engines available in the latest version of `PyRomusa AI`:

|Engine Name|Advantages|Disadvantages|
|:---------:|:---------|:------------|
|  `stable` |In general, it writes more correctly in terms of word order, and the chatbot's response is also much easier to read and understand.|High chances of not understanding an extremely short prompt (e.g. a word or two), even if it has it as an example in training, also returning a fairly easy fallback message.|
|  `chaos`  |Makes more of an effort to understand a message, so the chances of returning an automatic fallback message are lower.|In general, he writes some strange and quite difficult to understand messages, often not knowing what the chatbot meant. It can also write too many or too few words, thus compounding the difficulty of fully understanding what the chatbot meant.|
| `modern`  |It is the first engine based on NumPy. It doesn't matter if you write letters with diacritics or accents or not, the chatbot will still understand. It can now return a generated answer to a one-word prompt, without returning a fallback message, as we encounter, completely the opposite, in the `stable` engine.|In general, the response generation time is longer than in other available engines (`chaos`, `stable`). Also, in the latest STABLE version, the memory function of the last conversation is mandatory, you cannot remove it, even if you have `with_memory=False` in your function (an attempt will be made to solve this problem in the future).|


### Short tutorial/code: **How to use an engine of your choice?**

---

_By the way_: This is a complete tutorial. **If you are only interested in how to select the engine when you want to generate a response, then skip to step 5.**

---

1. First, import the Chatbot from PyRomusa AI

``` python
from PyRomusa_AI import Chatbot
```

2. Create an instance of the chatbot

``` python
bot = Chatbot(chatbot_name="test")
```

3. Add training examples or upload a prepared dataset

``` python
bot.trainer.add_data(
                    training_input_example= "...",
                    training_output_example= "..."
                    )

# AND / OR...

bot.prepared_datasets.romanian.load_prepared_dataset(
                                                    dataset_name="..."
                                                    )
```

4. Start the training

``` python
bot.trainer.start()
```

5. Generate the answer... **choosing the engine you want**
``` python
print(bot.reply_at(
    prompt="Hey Chatbot!",
    engine_name="chaos" # Here you write the name of the desired engine
))
```

## More ➕

### 1. When will you be able to install the library with just `pip install PyRomusa_AI` from bash?

An exact date for this has not yet been decided, but it is planned for this to happen in the near future, when `PyRomusa AI` will evolve further and have a minimum community.

### 2. What methods do I have to learn to use `PyRomusa AI?`

At the moment _(February 19, 2026)_, these PyRomusa AI learning options are quite limited, but you have the following methods:

1. Find random codes through this repository
    - In almost every README.md there is a piece of code where `PyRomusa AI` is used. Look at these and get inspired

2. Watch videos about PyRomusa AI, specifically on the TikTok account <span style="color:lightblue">@pyromusa_ai</span>
    - Sometimes, videos are posted on this TikTok account just about `PyRomusa AI`: from updates and little jokes to code and tutorials. Scroll through the videos here and find what you want.

3. Look in the `📁 tutorials/` folder in this repository

    - This folder, at the moment, does not have a code tutorial, but only a few text guides to solve problems like 'Why can't I load a prepared dataset?' or 'How do I setup PyRomusa AI in my code?', but it is planned to include code tutorials here in the future.

4. Use the prepared dataset 'Teacher for PyRomusa AI'

    - Yes, you can load this prepared dataset for your chatbot in your code, and then ask it questions. This dataset has input-output examples, specifically designed to answer your questions about PyRomusa AI. Indeed, it can't answer every question because of the poor vocabulary specifications and the number of examples, but it can answer basic questions. (By the way, you need to know Romanian to use it)


5. Install `PyRomusa AI` & Run the code:
```python
from PyRomusa_AI import Chatbot

# Create a chatbot
bot = Chatbot()

# Get help
bot.helper.how_to_start()
```

**Note:** Versions prior to `BETA 0.0.1` were initially released under the name `muri_ai`.
**The project has been renamed to `PyRomusa_AI` to avoid naming conflicts and for better branding.**
